# Brief Introduction 

Demo for the construction of IntEnzyDB, a database for storing enzyme kinetics-structure data.


The **rate** of the reaction catalyzed by enzyme E
$$\mathrm{A}+\mathrm{B} \Longleftrightarrow \mathrm{P}$$
 is defined as $$\frac{-\Delta[\mathrm{A}]}{\Delta \mathrm{t}} \; or \; \frac{-\Delta[\mathrm{B}]}{\Delta \mathrm{t}} \; or \; \frac{-\Delta[\mathrm{P}]}{\Delta \mathrm{t}}$$

- $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ changes are negative because the substrates are disappearing
- $\mathrm{P}$ change is positive because product is being formed.
