# Brief Introduction 

Demo for the construction of IntEnzyDB, a database for storing enzyme kinetics-structure data.


The **rate** of the reaction catalyzed by enzyme E

$$A+B \Longleftrightarrow P$$
 is defined as $$\frac{-\Delta[A]}{\Delta t} \; or \; \frac{-\Delta[B]}{\Delta t} \; or \; \frac{\Delta[P]}{\Delta t}$$

- $A$ and $B$ changes are negative because the substrates are disappearing
- $P$ change is positive because product is being formed.
