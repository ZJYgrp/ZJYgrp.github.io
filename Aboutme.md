# Project Director

![](./pics/John.jpeg)

I am an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and also affiliated to the Data Science Institute. My group and I are actively exploring tremendous opportunities in the interface between computational chemical biology and data science. Born in Tianjin, China, I graduated from Nankai University with a B.S. degree in Chemistry (Po-Ling class) in 2013. I received my Ph.D. with Prof. K. N. Houk in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2017. During my graduate career, we developed computational tools to simulate single-molecule reaction trajectories in solvent and in enzyme, which enables the elucidation of time-resolved mechanisms of biomolecular transformations in the condensed environment. From 2018 to 2020, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the group of Prof. Heather J. Kulik in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time, we leveraged large-scale quantum mechanics computation and molecular dynamics simulations to quantify constrained-peptide switch, understand the catalytic origins of methyltransferases, and predict the catalytic actions of glycyl radical enzymes in human gut microbiota.

## Sarah Torrence

**Master Student, Data Science Institute**

[sarah.k.torrence@Vanderbilt.Edu](sarah.k.torrence@Vanderbilt.Edu)

I am a current graduate student at Vanderbilt pursuing an MS in Data Science. I graduated from Denison University in 2016 with a degree in Mathematics and minor in Economics. Over the last five years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to grow as a data science professional in various fields and industries including education, criminology, financial services, and digital advertising. I am inspired by the way we can apply analytics and creativity to the data of our past to gain insights and create a better future.
