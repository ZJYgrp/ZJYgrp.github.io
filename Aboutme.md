# Project Director

![](./pics/John.jpeg)

I am an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and also affiliated to the Data Science Institute. My group and I are actively exploring tremendous opportunities in the interface between computational chemical biology and data science. Born in Tianjin, China, I graduated from Nankai University with a B.S. degree in Chemistry (Po-Ling class) in 2013. I received my Ph.D. with Prof. K. N. Houk in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2017. During my graduate career, we developed computational tools to simulate single-molecule reaction trajectories in solvent and in enzyme, which enables the elucidation of time-resolved mechanisms of biomolecular transformations in the condensed environment. From 2018 to 2020, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the group of Prof. Heather J. Kulik in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During this time, we leveraged large-scale quantum mechanics computation and molecular dynamics simulations to quantify constrained-peptide switch, understand the catalytic origins of methyltransferases, and predict the catalytic actions of glycyl radical enzymes in human gut microbiota.
